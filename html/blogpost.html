            <p class="dog-p"><u>Golden Retrievers</u> often exude <em>friendliness</em> as they engage with people and other animals. Part of this comes down to confidence. Goldens tend to have a <strong>cheery</strong> outlook that helps them navigate the world with
                ease. Moreover, a golden is almost always willing to sit for pets for as long as a person wants.</p>

            <p class="dog-p">With their warm eyes and cheerful grins, <u>Labradore Retrievers</u> are the <em>picture of friendliness</em>. Labs were bred to be companions—first to fishermen and then to hunters. They <strong>adore</strong> being around people, and they
                maintain a sweet, carefree nature. But they are high-energy dogs that need vigorous exercise every day.</p>

            <p class="dog-p"><u>Beagles</u> are a <em>cheerful</em> breed that truly enjoys spending time with people. They are fairly active and <strong>love</strong> playing fetch or going on long walks with their humans. They’re always down to have some fun and are
                happy to snuggle with their favorite people at the end of the day.

            <p class="dog-p"><u>Border Collies</u> aim to please. They are <em>constantly</em> in tune with their humans, which helps them succeed in dog sports, such as agility and flying disc, as well as everyday training. But minimizing a border collie's desire to
                herd everything in sight is a <strong>must</strong>, as this can cause them to nip people.</p>
